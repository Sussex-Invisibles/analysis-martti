Private repository of Martti's work at Sussex (2017-2020).

Check out the various C++ files to see what they do.

Some notable subdirectories:

* ambe_mc           => Simulation of the AmBe source with modified geometry, since taken over by Cindy
* angular_dist      => Macros for obtaining the TELLIE angular systematic fits
* dinucleon         => Simulation of the dinucleon decay modes used for the ND paper
* doublebeta        => Parameter space plots for 0vbb decay - nice to use in talks
* fibre_validation  => Macros for obtaining the TELLIE fibre position fits, now contained in nearline processor
* include           => Header files with commonly used functions and imports (C++/ROOT/RAT)
* laserball         => Simulation (standalone) of the laser diffuser flask, based on D. Grant's thesis
